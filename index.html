						<h2>Here's an overview of our project.</h2>
						<p>This project explores how climate, environment, and socioeconomic conditions influence the spread of climate-sensitive diseases in the Philippines. Using the Project CCHAIN dataset, which combines 20 years of health, climate, environmental, and socioeconomic data across 12 cities, we aim to uncover patterns that explain why some communities face higher risks than others.

Our approach is to link disease data (like dengue or leptospirosis) with climate factors (temperature, rainfall, humidity), environmental hazards (floods, landslides), and social indicators (population density, wealth, access to healthcare). By doing this, we can identify the biggest drivers of disease vulnerability, highlight disparities between communities, and build predictive models that can give early warnings for outbreaks.</p>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>We're motivated by one big question: why are some communities hit harder by climate-sensitive diseases than others? If we can answer that, we can help design smarter and fairer health programs.

								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p>In the Philippines, diseases like dengue, leptospirosis, and cholera often spike during floods, heavy rains, or sudden climate shifts. At the same time, not every community is affected the same way—some areas have better healthcare, safer environments, or more resources than others. The problem is that we don't have a clear picture of how climate, environment, and social conditions all come together to affect disease risks.</p>

								<h3>Solution</h3>
								<p>Our project uses the Project CCHAIN dataset, which brings together health, climate, environmental, and socioeconomic data from different cities. By studying these factors side by side, we can see what really drives outbreaks and build models that help predict when and where diseases might spread. This way, local governments and communities can be better prepared and act early.</p>

                    <div id="detail-templates" style="display:none;">
                        <template id="tpl-climate">
                            <img src="images/climate_fig1.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto 1rem; border:1px solid #eee; padding:4px;" />
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								Climate atmospheric variables, specifically heat index and estimated rainfall, were analyzed to assess their influence on the climate-sensitive disease, dengue. The effects of these variables are depicted in the graphs, with all values normalized to facilitate clearer visualization and comparison alongside dengue case trends.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The recorded temperature and heat index data reveal clear seasonal fluctuations typical of the Philippines' climate. A noticeable pattern emerges from 2014 to 2020, where spikes in temperature are consistently followed by corresponding increases in dengue cases. This suggests a potential lagged relationship between rising temperatures and dengue incidence. However, after 2020, this pattern appears to diminish as dengue cases level off and no longer show the same responsiveness to temperature changes. This disruption likely coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced reporting, human behavior, or other factors affecting dengue transmission, thereby interrupting the previously observed seasonal trend.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								A similar seasonal fluctuation can be observed with estimated rainfall, aligning with the Philippines' characteristic wet and dry seasons. Notably, the intensity of rainfall events appears to increase over the years, with more pronounced spikes in recent periods. Like temperature, increases in rainfall often precede or coincide with rises in dengue cases. Additionally, the disruption in dengue case patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic is also evident in the rainfall graph.
							</p>

							<img src="images/climate_fig2.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto 1rem; border:1px solid #eee; padding:4px;" />
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								To gain a deeper insight into the impact of these variables, we examined the correlation between each climate variable and dengue cases. Using Pearson correlation to assess pairwise relationships on data from 2014 to 2022, none of the climate variables exhibited a strong linear correlation with dengue cases. Even if we account for lagging with the incidence, it only resulted in approximately moderate linear correlations between variables.
							</p>

							<img src="images/climate_fig3.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto 1rem; border:1px solid #eee; padding:4px;" />
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								Even if we do limit the data range from 2014 to 2020, pre-COVID19 pandemic, results were better but still resulted with showing approximately moderate linear correlation between variables.

							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The top graph shows a temporal graph of the outbreaks of dengue through the years. This shows when the dengue risk is high, and we can assume that in a year, there are intervals wherein there is a sudden rise in dengue cases.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The bottom graph shows the static flood exposure of the barangays in the city (Cagayan de Oro). This means that, on average, 12.5% of a given barangay is susceptible to low-level flooding (up to the ankles), 25% of a given barangay is susceptible to medium level flooding (up to the knees), while around 17.5% of a given barangay is susceptible to high level flooding (flooding near the neck). 
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								This shows that dengue outbreaks align with the city's consistent exposure to flood-prone conditions, particularly in barangays with high flood hazard areas. Both figures show that because of the susceptibility of many barangays in Cagayan de Oro to flooding of different levels, they are much prone to acquiring Dengue, especially during the rainy months, where Dengue thrives due to the abundance of water, which could be a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

                        </template>

                        <template id="tpl-socio">

                            <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								In plot 1, We see a moderate negative correlation between Dengue Rate and Relative Wealth. This is a significant finding: in Cagayan de Oro, poorer barangays do tend to have higher rates of dengue. We also see a positive correlation with Population Density and a negative correlation with Health Facilities.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The 2nd plot clearly visualizes the negative correlation. The red trend line has a clear downward slope, indicating that as the average wealth of a barangay increases, its average annual dengue rate tends to decrease.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The 3rd plot shows that the trend line is positive, supporting the idea that denser barangays have higher dengue rates. This is consistent with the nationwide data but the relationship appears a bit clearer in this focused analysis.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								In the 4th plot, the median dengue rate is highest in barangays with 0 health facilities. The rate drops significantly for areas with 1, 2, or 3 facilities, before ticking up slightly for those with 4 or 5+. This suggests that having at least one local health facility is strongly associated with lower dengue rates in the city.

						<template id="tpl-combined">

							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The top graph shows the scatter plot of the <b>risk score versus disease cases at the barangay level</b>. This indicates that barangays with higher combined environmental and socioeconomic risk scores tend to report more disease cases. The regression line highlights the predictive trend, showing that as risk factors such as built-up density, flood hazard, and limited socioeconomic resilience increase, disease incidence also rises. This suggests that combining indicators provides a stronger signal of outbreak vulnerability compared to looking at single variables alone. 
							</p>
							
							<img src="images/combined_fig2.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto 1rem; border:1px solid #eee; padding:4px;" />
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								Looking closely at the scatter plot, there does not appear to be a strong linear trend between the composite risk score and disease cases. The points are widely dispersed, which suggests that the unweighted combination of environmental and socioeconomic indicators does not directly predict total disease counts. This outcome highlights that outbreaks are influenced by multiple interacting factors, and that some indicators may carry more weight than others depending on the disease. In other words, while the scatter plot shows the overall relationship is weak, it suggests the need for a heatmap, which helps identify which specific variables are more strongly associated with disease incidence.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The bottom graph shows the <b>correlation heatmap</b> between all selected indicators and disease cases. This reveals which specific factors are most strongly associated with outbreaks. For example, higher building density and greater flood hazard exposure show stronger correlations with disease totals, while landslide hazard has weaker or inconsistent relationships. The heatmap demonstrates that multiple indicators interact to shape disease vulnerability, reinforcing the importance of a composite approach.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em;margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								Together, the two figures show that barangays with dense built environments and significant hazard exposure are more prone to communicable diseases. This supports the conclusion that integrating environmental and socioeconomic indicators improves prediction of outbreaks, and provides a basis for identifying high-risk barangays for targeted interventions.

							<ul>
								<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">

							<ul>
								<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
									The visual dashboard provided initial evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>).
								</p>
								<li>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
										<b>Plot 1 (Heatmap):</b> A correlation heatmap revealed a <b>moderate negative correlation</b> between Relative Wealth and Dengue Rate, suggesting poorer barangays had higher rates. It also showed a <b>weak positive correlation</b> with Population Density.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
										<b>Plot 2 & 3 (Scatter Plots):</b> These plots confirmed the trends. The scatter plot for wealth (Plot 2) showed a clear downward-sloping trend line, indicating lower rates in wealthier barangays. The plot for density (Plot 3) showed an upward-sloping trend, indicating higher rates in more crowded areas. Each dot on these plots represented a single barangay.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
										<b>Plot 4 (Box Plot):</b> The analysis of healthcare access revealed a non-linear pattern. Barangays with <b>zero</b> health facilities had a visibly higher median dengue rate than those with one or more, suggesting that a complete lack of access is a significant vulnerability.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h4 style="text-align:left;">Statistical Hypothesis Test Results</h4>
							<ul>
								<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
									A multiple linear regression was performed to determine if these visual trends were statistically significant. The overall model was significant (F-statistic = 6.546, p = 0.000555) and explained 21.2% of the variance in dengue rates (R-squared = 0.212).
								</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
									The individual factor results are as follows:
								</p>
								<li>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
										<b>Relative Wealth (RWI):</b> This was a <b>highly significant</b> predictor (p = 0.0003). The negative coefficient confirms that as a barangay's average wealth increases, its dengue rate significantly <i>decreases</i>. This finding <b>strongly supports H<sub>1</sub></b>.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
										<b>Population Density:</b> This was also a <b>highly significant</b> predictor (p = 0.0001). The positive coefficient confirms that as a barangay's population density increases, its dengue rate significantly <i>increases</i>. This finding <b>also strongly supports H<sub>1</sub></b>.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
										<b>Healthcare Access:</b> This factor's p-value (p = 0.063) was just above the 0.05 threshold for significance. This indicates that once the powerful effects of wealth and density are accounted for, the <i>number</i> of health facilities was not a statistically significant predictor in this specific model.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h4 style="text-align:left;">Conclusion & Discussion</h4>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								<b>Based on the statistical evidence, we reject the null hypothesis (H0).</b>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								The analysis provides strong quantitative support for the alternative hypothesis (H1). The burden of dengue in Cagayan de Oro is not random but is significantly linked to socioeconomic conditions.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								We found that <b>relative wealth</b> and <b>population density</b> are two of the most significant drivers of dengue vulnerability. Barangays that are poorer and more crowded face a statistically higher risk. 
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:1.2em; margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
								While the visual plot for healthcare access was compelling, its lack of statistical significance in the final model suggests that the effects of poverty and density are more dominant. Future research could explore access in different ways, such as travel time to the nearest facility rather than just the count within the barangay.
